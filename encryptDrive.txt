1. unmount the drive.
  umount /mount/point

2. Run LUKS cryptsetup
  sudo cryptsetup -y -v luksFormat /dev/sd?

3. Open the drive
  sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sd?X sd?X_crypt

4. Format the drive.
  sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/sd?X_crypt

5. Create a mount point.
  sudo mkdir -p /some/folder

6. Mount the drive.
  sudo mount /dev/sd?X_crypt /mount/point

The following setups are for auto-mounting of the drive.
1. Create the keyfile
  sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/path/to/key/.keyfile bs=1024 count=4

2. Change the permissions to 0400
  sudo chmod 0400 /path/to/key/.keyfile

3. Add the key to luks
  sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sd?X /path/to/key/.keyfile

4. Find the UUID of the drive. The ID needed is /dev/??? (not /dev/mapper/???)
  sudo blkid

5. Edit the /etc/crypttab file
  sd?X_crypt UUID=<device UUID> /root/.keyfile luks,discard	# (New encrypted partition with keyfile that was generated)

6. Edit the /etc/fstab file
  /dev/mapper/sd?X_crypt  /<mount-point>   ext4    defaults        0       2

7. Change the ownership of the drive if needed.
  sudo chown <user>:<user> /<mount_point> -R
